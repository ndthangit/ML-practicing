    "You recently got a job as a machine learning scientist at a startup that wants to automate loan approvals. As your first project, your manager would like you to build a classifier to predict whether a loan will be paid back based on this data. There are two things to note. First, there is class imbalance; there are fewer examples of loans not fully paid. Second, it's more important to accurately predict whether a loan will not be paid back rather than if a loan is paid back. Your manager will want to know how you accounted for this in training and evaluation your model.\n",
